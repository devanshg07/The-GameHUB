## Getting Started

Hey! What's up? Welcome to my latest project called The GameHUB. Ever feel bored, and not have anybody to talk to, well The GameHub is the cure of boredom. The user is initally directed to a login screen, where they enter a username of their choice, and then the secret, or not so secret password of "12345". Upon successful login, the user is directed to a directoru fo four gaming buttons, being SnakeBall, FlappyBall, CatchyBalls and BallPong. Upon clicking a button, one game is executed and the user can play a game. If your computer contains JavaFX, feel free to download this repository and execute it. Enjoy!
